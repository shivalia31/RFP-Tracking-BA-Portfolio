# üìÑ BRD: RFP Lifecycle Tracker ‚Äì Business Analyst Portfolio Project

---

## 1. Project Title
**RFP Lifecycle Tracker** ‚Äì JIRA & Power BI Integrated Workflow for Proposal Management

---

## 2. Background
Organizations dealing with high volumes of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) often face inefficiencies in tracking, prioritizing, and responding to them. This project simulates the RFP process from intake to submission and reporting using a structured backlog (JIRA-style) and a Power BI dashboard for visualization and insights.

---

## 3. Business Objective
To create a centralized and efficient system for managing RFPs across various departments (Sales, Business Analysis, Technical, Design, and Proposal Management), while enabling real-time performance tracking and data-driven decision-making.

---

## 4. Scope

**In Scope**:
- Creating and managing user stories representing RFP lifecycle stages
- Simulating workflows and statuses (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
- Tracking task attributes like priority, story points, created/resolution dates
- Visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends in Power BI

**Out of Scope**:
- Integration with actual JIRA software
- External client or tool-based submission mechanisms
